# Boost your C++!

Sometimes the `std` facilities are not sufficient in your C++ program. You want to have access to certain functions that are not available at all in the `std` namespace. However, these are often available in one of the many `Boost` libraries! So don't hesitate, and go through the tutorial that shows you how to install these libraries, and then actually write a program with various `Boost` facilities.

## Tutorial

To give an introduction to the `Boost` libraries, a [tutorial](TUTORIAL.md) has been generated for this. This tutorial first shows you how to install all libraries via your command line. After that, an explanation will be given on how to set up your `CMakeLists.txt`.
An explanation is also given how `Boost` actually works. Finally, working pieces of code are also given, in which various facilities of this library are implemented.
